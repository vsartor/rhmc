Description: Implements simple Hamiltonian Monte Carlo routines in R for
             sampling from any desired target distribution which is continuous
             and smooth. See Neal (2017) <arXiv:1701.02434> for further details
             on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Automatic parameter selection is not
             supported.
